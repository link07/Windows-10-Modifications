# Disable Data Logging
This disables most data logging, and through disabling web search also makes search behave similarly to Windows 7

## Steps
There's been a lot of commotion over W10's privacy terms. I'm sure these methods can change/improve at any time, but here's a guide which should hopefully give you a relatively more private, safe experience, however at the risk of not being able to enjoy some of W10's features.

### Before/During Installation**
* Do **not** use ```Express Settings```. Hit ```Customize```, and make sure everything is turned off.
* It's strongly preferred that you use a **local account** with Windows 10.

### After Installation
* Head to ```Settings > Privacy```, and disable **everything**, unless there are some things you really need.
* While within the Privacy page, go to ```Feedback```, select ```Never``` in the first box, and ```Basic``` in the second box.
* Disable Cortana by clicking the ```Search``` bar/icon.
* Change the name of your PC by going to Start (or hitting the Windows key), typing *About PC*, and clicking *Rename PC*.

### Slightly Complex
* Open up the *Command Prompt* by launching **cmd** as an administrator, and enter the following:
> sc delete DiagTrack
>
> sc delete dmwappushservice
>
> echo "" > C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Diagnosis\ETLLogs\AutoLogger\AutoLogger-Diagtrack-Listener.etl

* Open up the ```Group Policy Editor``` by launching ```gpedit.msc``` as an administrator. Go through ```Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Data Collection and Preview Builds```. Double click ```Telemetry```, hit **Disabled**, then apply.
  * **NOTE: This only *truly* works in the Enterprise edition, but the final step provides a decent enough workaround for Pro users.**

* Open up the ```Registry Editor``` by launching ```regedit``` as an administrator. Go through ```HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\DataCollection```, select ```AllowTelemetry```, change its value to **0**, then apply.

* First, run InstallTakeOwnership.reg. Then, head to the ```hosts``` file by going through ```C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\Etc```, take ownership of the ```hosts``` file, and add all of the IPs from ips.txt

### Optional
* Disable web search in Search by going to Settings, and turning off ```Search online``` and include ```web results```.
  * Note: this doesn't work in the "creators" update, see the main readme for the new way to do this.
* Head to ```Settings > Update and Security > Advanced Options > Choose how updates are delivered```, and turn the first switch **off**.
* While still in the ```Group Policy Editor```, go through ```Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > OneDrive```, double click ```Prevent the usage of OneDrive for file storage```, hit **Enabled**, then apply. **NOTE: This disables OneDrive**
* While still in the ```Group Policy Editor```, go through ```Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Defender```, double click ```Turn Off Windows Defender```, hit **Enabled**, then apply. **NOTE: This disables Windows Defender**
* Replace Microsoft Edge/Internet Explorer with **Firefox**, **Chromium**, or any forks/variations of them.
* Replace Windows Media Player with **VLC** or **MPC-HC**
* Replace Groove Music with **Foobar2000**, **Winamp**, or **MusicBee**.
* Replace Photos/Windows Photo Viewer with **ImageGlass**, **IrfanView** or **paint.net**.
