# Enable Dark Theme
This is largely unnecessary now, as you can change this in settings.  Go to ```Settings > Personalization > Colors``` and switch ```Choose your default app mode``` to dark.  In Edge, go to ```Settings > Theme > Dark``` and enable it there.


# Old way
This doesn't work as well as it did in the beta, but it still changes some things
Run "Make Windows 10 Use Dark Theme.reg" to enable, run "Make Windows 10 Use Light Theme.reg" to disable

To make Windows Store use dark theme, press control+t with it up (This appears to not work on the release of Windows 10).
